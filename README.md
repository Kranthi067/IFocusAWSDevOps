Github branching strategy::


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dac55b58-d16d-4049-8a2b-4c3a8f979999)

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.02.24

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.02.24

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

please select base & compare branches so here base branch is release/2025.02.25 and compare branch is feature/2025.02.25

i'm going to merge code changes from feature branch to release branch

=============

1. completely we have occupied this session is issues resolutions and we will continue new topic in next session


27/02/2025::
============

If multiple developers OR DevOps Engineers are working on same Project/MOdules, if they tried to commits thier code changes to Repository, it will faces the  conflicts issues and how to resolved those conflicts issues in real time projects 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc72ca5-a9fd-407b-9d37-48824e5375b7)

Avoide conflicts:: Before pushing the code changes to github repository, make sure, you should be run the command -->git pull

>git pull --->git pull command is use, copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory (local directory) and merged code changes from remote repository to local repository 
>git fetch ---->The git fetch command only fetch the changes into your local Git repo and it will not merged anything. just fetch the details

Please create A,B,C directories in your local machine and clone the project code separately 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e786310-5092-4975-9eb9-7b18801353d8)

Editor steps for Resolved the conflicts::

editor::

1.press i from your keyboard, INCERT
2.press the esc from your keyboard at top left corner 
3.shift+: 
4.wq
